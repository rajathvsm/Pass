This app was built to test how much I could accomplish within a day, although this did take more than a day to complete and put it up on the Google Play store. You can find the app at 

I built this prototype RSS reader of my blog and can switch to popular and controversial Iranian site Balatarin.com's English blog. 

The main feature of this app is the ability to view web content without using the data connection. Please note that there is one phone which does download the content via Wifi/Mobile data, but then on, it is able to share and reshare the content to different Android smartphones running the same app.

There are no immediate plans of improving this app, due to other pressing concerns that I am busy with.
